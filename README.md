Who’s Committing Suicide???

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that each year approximately one million people die from suicide, which represents a global mortality rate of 16 people per 100,000 or one death every 40 seconds. It is predicted that by 2020 the rate of death will increase to one every 20 seconds.
And this is a very serious problem these days, So I decided to take a look into this matter and visualize the suicides happening around the world to answer the most obvious questions like which countries are more vulnerable to this and what is the age group who commits maximum suicide and many more.

I downloaded the suicides dataset from World Health organization website.

Let’s investigate some facts about the dataset:

The dataset has 43776 rows and 6 columns 

Columns:
Country year: 1979-2016
Sex: M/F
Age: Age group
Suicides no: Number of suicides
Population: Number of all living people
